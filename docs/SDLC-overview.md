# ðŸ§© SDLC Overview

The SmartHome Energy Dashboard follows the **Agile SDLC model**, ensuring iterative delivery and constant feedback.

## Phases
1. **Requirements Gathering:** Identify energy monitoring needs of users.
2. **Design:** Define UI layout, API data flow, and smart device integration.
3. **Implementation:** Simulated development of modules (energy usage, device control, reports).
4. **Testing:** Functional and integration testing (mocked in this documentation).
5. **Deployment:** Release dashboard to homeowners.
6. **Maintenance:** Continuous enhancement based on user feedback.

Each Sprint is treated as a mini-SDLC cycle.
